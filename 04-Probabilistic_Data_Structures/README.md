# Probabilistic Data Structures

In this week exercises you will play with the two probabilistic data structures
you have seen in the lecture. The bloom filter and the CountMin Sketch. First,
you will implement a simple [heavy hitter detector](./01-Heavy_Hitter_Detector) using a bloom filter. After,
you will use a [count min sketch](./02-Count-Min-Sketch) to count packets for different flows and compare
its accuracy depending on memory allocation.
